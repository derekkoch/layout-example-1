		<h1>Spacing</h1>

		<p>This paragraph is normal. It has no indentation, margins, padding, 
			letter spacing, word spacing, text justification, or line spacing.</p>

		<p class="elegant">This paragraph has many forms of spacing. The first line of text 
			is indented. Margins indent the paragraph on all sides. Padding puts space between paragraph and its borders. Letters have 1 extra pixel of space between them. Words
			have 2 extra pixels of space between them. Text is justified, which adds extra space
			between words to align text to the left and right edges. And lines have extra 
			spacing between them.</p>
